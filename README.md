# sota.js

Charting library for *The Phillipian*'s [annual State of the Academy survey project](http://pdf.phillipian.net/2019/05102019.pdf) by Samson Zhang EDE CXLII (@wwsalmon). Built on d3. Currently WIP.

# Installation

Using browser/plain JS: download `dist/sota.min.js` (eventually this will be in releases...) and include it in your project:

`<script src="PATH/TO/sota.min.js"></script>`

Using npm (not recommended for now, I'm working on it):

`npm i sota.js`

# Usage

If npm:

`import sota from "sota.js"`

Then (or just by including the script in browser/plain JS) you have access to the `sota` object and can call functions like `sota.barChart()`. Detailed instructions on component parameters and usage to come.
